For planning out my career, I realized it would be a good excercise to layout key events that I believe will happen throughout this century, starting from current (2022). I know predicting the future is futile since its *never right*, but as Eisenhower said, "In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensible".

It is also easy to fall into thinking in terms of incremental progress without long term projections decades ahead. Alan Kay recommends taking out an idea to 30 years ahead where there is no possibiity of increment from present, and reversing back to figure out what technologies need to be developed. (this is how he took the dynabook to an iPad)
