### who I respect 
 Jaron Lanier, Alan Kay, Robert Zubrich (mars society), Charles Hoskinson (cardano)

&nbsp;

### academia
 Marvin Minsky, Steven Pinker, Niel Ferguson, Richard Feynman, Miyzaki Ichisada

&nbsp;

### entrepreneurs
 Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, George Hotz, Josiah Zayner, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Ted Turner, Intel trinity, Bill Gates 

&nbsp;

### questions
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
    - in the current projection, computers will have disasterous effects on remaining industries
- why were "moonshot" projects in the past successful?
    - xerox parc - 9 key technologies for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in only 6 years (1939~1945) 
    - apollo project - landing a man on moon within a decade
- how do you develop developed countries?


&nbsp;
### life as a projects concept 
I identified six projects that I want to work on during my lifetime. Each project will be allocated a 10-year timeframe. The projects will have periodic reviews to make sure the project is progressing accordingly. The timeline of the projects will have to reiterated to make adjustments as I figure out the best way it works for me. Under my assumption that medical technologies will be advanced enough that I will have a sharp mind/ physically healthy until I die, I should be able to work on six projects. 

&nbsp;

I added more reviews upfront since there is potential to make large improvements to optimize the projects:  

&nbsp;

**end of year 1.** 
- Make sure the goal for the next 10 years is expressed clearly, with KPIs so that success (or failure) can be measured properly
- Make sure the goal is *relevant* with the timeframe you are working on (don't start a project too early or too late)
- Run some small scale experiments to check bottlenecks. Flush out the risks involved in the projects. Brainstorm ideas to overcome the risks. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 3.**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Is it progressing accordingly? If it is not, this would be the time to radically change approach. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 5**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Find out what are bottlenecks in the progress of project, make minor changes as required
- There should be **NO radical changes** to the approach at this stage. Even if your stuck with an less than optimal approach, stick with your guns
- Review improvements that can be made. Implement to guide the project to success in the next five years

&nbsp;

**end of year 10.** 
- review the result of the project
- list lessons to learned that can be translated to future projects

&nbsp;

### project list

**project 1.** 

Built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan, at a scale equivalent to Toyota/Sony

&nbsp;

Background:

The progress made in developed countries are showing signs of stagnation. Though developing countries, including China, are making rapid progress by following the footsteps of developed nations, there is no clear indication that they have solution for the next steps mankind will take. 

&nbsp;

Reason:

 I believe one solution to develop *developed* countries is for future entrepreneurs to adopt the methodology that Elon Musk follows to pursue audacious projects. It would be exciting to see thousands of Elon Musk-styled businesses springing up around the world taking a highly effective approach to solving world problems. The company will demonstrate that Elon's approach can be applied by any organization around the world. 

&nbsp;

KPIs: 

- number one company traded on the nikkei index

&nbsp;


**project 2.** 

Build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D for space exploration 

&nbsp;

Background

The Space X Starship in development now is planning to reach orbit by the end of this year. Having the capacity to launch over a hundred passengers, we will see an unprecedented number of visitors to space, mainly to the most accessible LEO, in the next 5-10 years. 

&nbsp;

Reason

- current space technologies to sustain human life are too exotic/expensive for millions of people to have access to
- there is a need for development of substitute materials that will reduce costs and increase manufactorability 

&nbsp;

Concept

- low budget commited for ~10 year period
- small number of elite scientists (20-30) gathered from worldwide 

&nbsp;

KPIs

- five nobel prizes from the institution within 5 decades 

&nbsp;

**project 3.** fix education by creating a flagship school 

Background

Education has made little to no progress in the last 100 years. Many bright minds have taken a shot at fixing it, but has not been successful. 

Reason:
TBD

Concept: 

implement the environment of future proposed by Alan Kay in schools

KPIs:
TBD

&nbsp;

- project 4. TBD
- project 5. TBD
- project 6. TBD
