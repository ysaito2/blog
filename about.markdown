## RANDOM IDEAS:
* NLP project with a lex friedman podcast
* biohacking community as a neighborhood watch rather than restricting like CA
* youtube channel going over the the Odin Bioengineering 101 content in a much more digestable way, videos going through each experiment step-by-step with pointers would be nice
* clean online guide for biohacking 
*

## QUESTIONS:
* Do octopuses have multiple consciousnesses?
    * Tentacles are able to make decisions on their own!
* Humans used to have a high emphasis on spatial awareness. (placement of windows/furniture in Chinese homes, church design) Now we understand the world through abstractions with linguistics. Is that progress or just another way of interacting/understanding the world?
* Why is there always a ratio of people born gay? 
    * Is that due to the environment? Or is there some strategic advantage of having a ratio of gay people in a population? Michenangelo, Da Vinci, etc lots of inventive people were gay. 
* Greeks had a much more complicated human relationship, more “types”of love (for instance, love between an older man / younger man, but with no physical relationship). Modern society is intolerant/very few definitions of relationships between individuals (co-worker, family, friends, girl friend, etc) 
* How has the concept of love evolved over generations? Is it better to have a more varied “types” of relationships between individuals? 
* Whats with 19th-20th vienna? Why were there so many talented people??
