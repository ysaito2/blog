&nbsp;

### entrepreneurs
 Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, George Hotz, Josiah Zayner, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Ted Turner, Intel trinity, Bill Gates 

&nbsp;

### questions
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
    - is the open/free concept the only way for the internet?
- why were "moonshot" projects in the past successful?
    - xerox parc - all technology for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in only 6 years (1939~1945) 
    - apollo project - landing in man on moon within a decade
- how do you develop developed countries?


&nbsp;
### life as a projects concept 
I identified six projects that I want to work on during my lifetime. Each project will be allocated a 10-year timeframe. The projects will have periodic reviews, just like a NASA project, to make sure the project is progressing accordingly. The timeline of the projects will have to reiterated to make adjustments as I figure out the best way it works for me. My assumption is that medical technologies will be advanced enough that I will have a sharp mind/ physically healthy until I die, in which case I should be able to work on six projects. 

&nbsp;

The structure of the project will be the following: 

**end of year 1.** 
- Make sure the goal for the next 10 years is expressed clearly, with KPIs so that success (or failure) can be measured properly
- Make sure the goal is *relevant* with the timeframe you are working on (don't start a project too early or too late)
- Run some small scale experiments to check bottlenecks. Flush out the risks involved in the projects. Brainstorm ideas to overcome the risks. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 3.**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Is it progressing accordingly? If it is not, this would be the time to radically change approach. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 5**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Find out what are bottlenecks in the progress of project, make minor changes as required
- There should be **NO radical changes** to the approach at this stage. Even if your stuck with an less than optimal approach, stick with your guns
- Review improvements that can be made. Implement to guide the project to success in the next five years

&nbsp;

**end of year 10.** 
- review the result of the project
- list lessons to learned that can be translated to future projects

### project list

- project 1. built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan, like Toyota/Sony

&nbsp;

- project 2. build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D for space exploration 
    - I realized I enjoy talking to researchers / process of scientific discovery
    - five nobel prizes from the institution within 5 decades 
    - low budget commited for ~10 year period
    - any audacious engineering projects require pushing boundary of material science 

&nbsp;

- project 3. fix education: create a flagship school (with environment of future as in Alan Kay talk) for future generations 
    - I spent two summers working in education non-profit! I really care

&nbsp;

- project 4. TBD
- project 5. TBD
- project 6. TBD
