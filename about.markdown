### my values 
1. engineering 

Amongst the exciting developments in engineering around the world, I believe this century will be remembered as the first century which humanity set out to colonize space. I want my role to build technology, like low cost spacesuit, life support systems, space habitats, to enable millions to live, work, and raise their families outside of our planet. We've had extraordinary accomplishments in the last two centuries. We need to move away from incremental progress and go back to setting ambition goals. 

&nbsp;
2. science

Science helps us understand the boundaries of what's possible. 

&nbsp;
3. education

Education has turned from obtaining knowledge and skills into a race to who gets the best insurance plan. As the number of children in developed countries decrease, there is a desperate need to train high skill workers who can create massive value with less people if we want human progress to continue. We need to take a radically new approach to preparing future generations.

### questions
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
    - in the current projection, computers will have disasterous effects on remaining industries
- why were "moonshot" projects in the previous century so successful?
    - xerox parc - 9 key technologies for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in only 6 years (1939~1945) 
    - apollo project - landing a man on moon within a decade
- how do you develop developed countries?
