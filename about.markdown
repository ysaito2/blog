## my values 
### engineering

Amongst the exciting achievements have been to be done, I believe this century will be remembered as the first century when humanity set out to colonize space. I want my role to build technology, like low cost spacesuit, life support systems, space habitats, to enable millions to live, work, and raise their families outside of our planet. We've made extraordinary progress in the last two centuries. We need to move away from incremental progress and go back to setting ambition goals.

### science

Science allows us define the boundaries of what's possible. I believe it is important to continue pushing forward with our understanding of the natural world to create a foundation not only for ourselves, but future generations to build new technologies that push the frontier of mankind. 

&nbsp;
### education

Education has turned from obtaining knowledge and skills into a race to who gets the best insurance plan. As the number of children in developed countries decrease, there is a desperate need to train high skill workers who can create massive value with less people if we want human progress to continue. We need to take a radically new approach to preparing future generations.

### decenteralized-industry

Technological advancements like biomass-chemical industry, microgrids, and 3D printers are projecting a future where we create many small scale factories to generate a secondary source of income for rural/remote parts of the world. I am excited for the opportunities of decenteralized industry to lift up the standard of living in rural and urban parts of the world.

### human-centeric-industry

If we continue our current trajectory, we are heading into a future where *nobody can make a living with their jobs* due to networked computers. We need to course-correct to create a society which gives credit to contributing data, knowledge, and work to improve the algorithms that will run our society. I strongly believe retaining and protecting the market dynamics should be prioritized above universal basic income. The faster the micropayment economy is implemented, the more industries we can keep thriving with opportunities and jobs for all.

## questions
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
    - in the current projection, computers will have disasterous effects on remaining industries
- why were "moonshot" projects in the previous century so successful?
    - xerox parc - 9 key technologies for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in only 6 years (1939~1945) 
    - apollo project - landing a man on moon within a decade
- how do you develop developed countries? 
    - in other words, **where do we go from here?**
