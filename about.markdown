## my values
I have listed five key areas that I believe are the most important during my lifetime. 

&nbsp;
### engineering

This century will be remembered as the first century when humanity set out to colonize space. I want to design/manufacture technologies to enable millions to live, work, and raise their families outside of our planet. I believe we need to follow the trajectory of the last two decades by tackling the impossible by creating technologies, companies, and even industries. 

&nbsp;
### science

It is important to continue pushing forward with our understanding of the natural world to realize what was thought to be *impossible* is *possible*. I will dedicate my resources to creating and supporting research institutes around the world tackling the conventions of our era. 

&nbsp;
### education

Education has turned from obtaining knowledge and skills into a race to who gets the best insurance plan. As the world population is expected to plateau towards the end of the century, there is a need to train high skilled workers who can create massive value if we want human progress to continue. We need a new approach to preparing future generations. 

&nbsp;
### decenteralized-industry

Technological advancements like biomass-chemical industry, microgrids, blockchain, and 3D printers are projecting a future where rural/remote communities can create many small-scale factories, infrastructure, and even industries to generate a secondary source of income. I am excited for the opportunities of decenteralized industries to lift up the standard of living around the world. 

&nbsp;
### human-centeric-industry

If we continue our current trajectory, we are heading into a future where *nobody can make a living with their jobs* due to technical advancement and networked computers. We need to course-correct to create a society which gives credit to those contributing data, knowledge, and work to improve the algorithms that will run our society. I strongly believe *protecting the market dynamics should be prioritized* above universal basic income.

## questions
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
    - in the current projection, computers will have disasterous effects on remaining industries
- why were "moonshot" projects in the previous century so successful?
    - xerox parc - 9 key technologies for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
        - build on previous *8 years* of development in ARPA
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in only 6 years (1939~1945) 
    - apollo project - landing a man on moon within a decade
- how do you develop developed countries? 
    - in other words, **where do we go from here?**
