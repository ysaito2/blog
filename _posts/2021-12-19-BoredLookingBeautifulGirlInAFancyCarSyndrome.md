Have you ever looked inside a really fancy car (Bently Continental class) stopped at a red traffic light in the city? 

&nbsp;

A fair looking man with a little too much hair wax is driving a beautiful girl in a passenger seat looking outside the window. I've seen many of them in Tokyo and interestingly never seen a single girl looking *happy*. They have eyes like a dead fish, their elbows placed on the side door panel, their hand placed under their cheeks. No lively conversations in the car. Something is wrong. 

&nbsp;

I believe the beautiful girl got everything she *thought* she wanted. She won the affection of the successful man, who must have been popular inside the social community, outsmarting her rivals in the process. Boy, it must have been a thrill ride, thinking of what clothes to wear, what conversations to have, and making sure to conceal her intentions to her rivals while slowly winning the affection of the popular man. But once the game was over, she realizes this wasn't what she wanted. She's looking out that window from her passenger seat thinking, "Why ain't I happy?"

&nbsp;

If you have read my previous blog posts, you may have realized I love making terminologies. Well, this will be the best one yet: "the bored beautiful girl in a passenger seat of an expensive car syndrome". Its the state one realizes after working hard and achieving their goals that **it wasn't actually what they wanted**. Its highly relevant to clever and hardworking people who know how to win the game. I see it everywhere in our society, not just inside $200,000 luxury coupes. 

&nbsp;

Its important to find methods to avoid this syndrome. The last thing you want is to spent years working towards a goal and realizing *after* achieiving it that it wasn't actually what you wanted. Some will hesitate to pursue their goals when they know the risk of the syndrome is there. 

&nbsp;

One solution is the resources provided by [80,000 hour](https://80000hours.org/), which proposes a structured approach to defining your career goals. They identify four key factors to consider: problem, solution, leverage, and personal fit. They provide a great worksheet where you can go through questions to identify what problem you should work on next, accessible from their website for free. The [80,000 hour podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/) includes a wealth of insight about the world that anyone should listen to, regardless of career path. 

&nbsp;

Another solution is to periodically detach yourself from the "buzz" of the game and ask yourself if the goal is still worth pursuing. Are you enjoying the game for the sake of it, or are you building towards a future that is worthwhile? If you wince reading the question, you need to stop and reflect.  

&nbsp;

The solution I realized has worked for me is to ask yourself whether you will be bored working on the project five years from now. I don't think you can achieve anything meaningful unless you commit at least five years into the project. If you know you will be bored before then, its probably not as challenging or important as you want. Hence, not worth pursuing. 

&nbsp;

I've also realized for many people **winning the game is the goal**, and the name of the game doesn't really matter. Once they win in one game, they move on to the next and the next, etc until they are too old to continue. I am not a fan of the approach, but many  derive meaning in their careers this way. I am not sure if this advice will be helpful to all the bored beautiful girls out there, but it is what it is. 

&nbsp;

I believe "the bored beautiful girl in a passenger seat of an expensive car syndrome" is a condition that will haunt current and future generations to come. Doesn't matter if we create a metaverse, integrate our brains with superhuman AI, or become an interplanetary species. 

&nbsp;

The question is how do we derive meaning in our lives?
