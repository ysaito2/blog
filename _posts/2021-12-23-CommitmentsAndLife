Until my mid-twenties, I used to think making commitments was for losers.

I mean, nothing about the system of marriage makes any sense. Commiting one's life to a partner you happened to meet in your 20's or 30's for the rest of your life? Spending 100,000s of $$$ to raising a child, with the additional bonus of a year of sleepless nights, huge number of hours commited that could be spent doing *anything* else. And you'd think if you spent so much money and hours it would be successfull, until you learn half of all marriages in the US ends up in a divorce. Its like working for 20 years to buy a multi-million dollar personal jet  which has a 50% chance of crashing and burning on the first flight.

And the guys starting their own company? Really, when you have a choice of being an employee who can jump boat anytime things start looking bad? Just go in, do whatever easy job that's assigned to you, enjoy the stability and paychecks that keep streaming in, regardless of how the company is performing. Why the hell would you chain yourself to a ship that has an even bigger chance of sinking than a Imperial Japanese Navy Ship during WWII? 

&nbsp;

Except that life doesn't mean jackshit until you make commitments. Travelling the world with your labtop, jumping jobs to discover who you are, casual relationships and all is great. But at one point you have to settle down, make a stand, grind your teeth, and fight for your values.
