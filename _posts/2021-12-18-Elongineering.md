Elon Musk has figured out a systematic method for solving audacious problems by building organizations and technologies. I believe this is the fundamental characteristic that differentiates Elon from any other prominent entrepreneurs in the past (and current). Its difficult to imagine Bezos or Zuckerburg building another multi-billion dollar business from scratch, even though both are young enough (with enough vigor) to go through the arduous task. As for Elon, if you extend his lifespan by an extra 50 years, its easy to image him pumping out at least 2, or 3 more multi-billion busineses. Another 100 years, he will have at least another 10 more. I believe the reader will agree this isn't a preposterous statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I've decided to call Elon's systematic approach "Elongineering". My ambition is to get the terminology on the Merriam-Webster dictionary by sometime until 2030! I will get back to why this goal isn't as silly as it sounds. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

So what exactly is "Elongineering"? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I repeatedly write above, it is a *systematic* approach to building companies and technologies to solve audacious problems. Its not dependent on the skills, history, and blind luck of the individual. You don't have to be in programmer in Harvard who happened to be hired part-time to build a social media platform. You don't have to be a consultant who saw the potential of the internet at her infancy. Following the principles, anyone should be able tackle difficult problems
