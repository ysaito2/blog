Elon Musk has figured out a systematic method for solving audacious problems by building organizations and technologies. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I believe this is the single characteristic that differentiates Elon from any other prominent entrepreneurs in the past (and current). Its difficult to imagine Bezos or Zuckerburg building another multi-billion dollar business from scratch, even though both are young (with enough vigor) to go through the arduous task. As for Elon, if you extend his lifespan by an extra 50 years, its easy to imagine him pumping out at least 2 or 3 more multi-billion dollar busineses. Another 100 years, he will have at least another 10 more. I believe the reader will agree this isn't a preposterous statement. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I've decided to call Elon's systematic approach "Elongineering" (I tried other words like Elonpreneurship, but they just don't have the right ring). My ambition is to get the terminology on the Merriam-Webster dictionary by 2030! I will get back to why this goal isn't as silly as it sounds. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

So what exactly is "Elongineering"? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I repeatedly write above, it is a *systematic* approach to building companies and technologies to solve audacious problems. You should be able to show your approach to convince the most talented engineers in the world to join your mission and raise money from investors. 
Following the principles, anyone should be able to kickass.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;

The following is a crude breakup of the approach:
1. Identify technical domain with high impact to society 
2. Thorough research of domain and existing companies 
3. List out problems + improvements that can be made to the current state-of-the-art
4. Identify the immediate problem and tackle it while prioritizing engineering design for fast iteration (simplicity/low cost materials)

&nbsp;&nbsp;

The list above is pretty obvious and honestly a bit useless. I know. Give me a little bit of time to get it right. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

How do we study Elongineering? As starters, there is a great book by Eric Berger "Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX" that covers, well as the title says the early days of SpaceX. There is also a great video by Everyday Astraunaut on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverydayAstronaut) explaining the engineering decisions made for the development of the Merlin and Raptor engines. Both are great resources to start studying how Elon builds technology and companies.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I also found that following the trajectory of Neurolink is a great resource for studying "Elongineering". Starting from the white paper published sometime around 2018, diving into the references of the paper, its easy to follow how the Neurolink team identified immediate problems and the methods they took to solve them. The earlier annoucements made by the company is clearly a period of "feeling" around the problem, while the most recent annoucement the shows a more clear direction of the company. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm having trouble finding great resources for Tesla, and other "smaller" projects like Boring company, online education for kids (forgot the name), Hyperloop, etc. I guess its more challenging to draw a clear trajectory for Tesla since Elon joined the company as an engineer and later became the CEO. The other smaller projects are "lets try this cool idea", more of a novelty rather than projects focused on solving a urgent/audacious problem. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

So why is it important to put "Elongineering" on the dictionary? Its not for the legacy of putting a word you created on the dictionary. It's the wide recognition by people worldwide that its a methodology that can be seperated from Elon Musk as an individual. So yes, you don't have to be in Silcon Valley during the internet bubble. And no, you don't have to drop out from Stanford graduate school. You don't even have to be an expert on twitter memes, though it would be fun to have more business leaders with a sense of humour. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

The implication of the widespread recognition of "Elongineering" across the world would be interesting. There should be a surge of Elon Musk-style businesses around the world taking a highly effective approach to solving challenging global problems. Humanity can keep on pushing the frontier long after Elon Musk is gone. The future seems exciting and bright. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Elongineering" has to be constructed far more formally than this blog post. At this point, I haven't fully analyzed the last *twenty* years of Elon's career, which would be a pain-staking task for careers far less significant. But it seems important to get this right. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

And how do we prove "Elongineering" is even a concept to take seriously? Isn't Elon's achievements a product of talent, hard work, and charisma that only he possess? A result of in-born intelligence, a slightly depressed and traumatized childhood? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is a fun thinking excercise: what if a Elon Musk style business immerges from a country outside of Western civilization, like I don't know, Japan? The company will set out on an audacious goal and systematically solve engineering problems following the "Elongineering" principles. It can be started by someone who isn't a dropout from the most prestigious universities in the US. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

And man, wouldn't it be crazy if this company is massively successful? It would be a living proof that "Elongineering" can be applied by companies anywhere around the world. The company can document and eventually publish the process of solving challenges it encountered as it build its own technology and organization. Future entreprenuers around the world will study the methodology and apply it to their own audacious problems. Thousands of super effective companies/organizations solving urgent local and global problems. Some of them will be pushing the frontiers of humanity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Wouldn't that be something?
