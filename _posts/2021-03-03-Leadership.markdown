Any member of an organization would ask themselves the question at one point in their careers: “Am I needed in my organization? Have I become dispensable? ”

&nbsp;&nbsp;


I believe anybody in an organization is dispensable, which is both a hopeful and sad statement. It is hopeful in a sense that there will always be a new brilliant talent that will lead the organization to new heights. But it is sad to acknowledge that no matter how hard you work, no matter how talented you regard yourself, there are people lined up to do a better job. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


Recently, I read a thorough biography of the current president of Russia, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (“The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin”). Putin is a mesmerizing figure in modern politics. A man from a humble background with a respectable, but an unremarkable career in the KGB, became the leader of Russia in the most unconventional way that frankly, even he didn’t anticipate. He was propelled into a leadership role in the most difficult times following the collapse of the Soviet Union, navigating the nation through uncertainties and hardships.


&nbsp;&nbsp;


Reading the path Russia took after the collapse of the Soviet Union abruptly reminded me of the seemingly irrelevant history of General Motors. The company’s history highlights the sharp contrast of leadership styles between Billy Durant, the charismatic founder who built GM from scratch, and Alfred Sloan, who later restructured the organization of GM to propel her to become one of the most successful companies in the world. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


I believe both Vladimir Putin and Billy Durant are visionary leaders. Durant was a carriage builder who saw the potential of the automotive industry at her infancy. He was a brilliant salesman who could pitch his idea to his colleagues and investors to pool resources to realize his vision. He understood the importance of controlling the supply chain and the diversity of car models to match every consumer’s budget and preference. He built the foundation of one of the most successful companies in the world. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


Putin is a relentless, strong male figure with an incorruptible character. He is a man of action: he immediately visits the site after a natural or man-made disaster to organize relief efforts. During a war, he visits the front lines, talking to soldiers one-by-one, galvanizing the troops. He understood that the Russian government must take control of her underutilized natural resources not only to boost the domestic economy, but as a leverage in international relations. He built the foundation of modern Russian from the ruins of the Soviet Union. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


But here’s another thing you should know about Billy Durant: he was a *horrible* administrator. Every decision within the company had to be approved by him; people lined up in front of his office for hours. There was no framework in the company for making decisions. Sometimes he would suddenly decide to purchase a company without consolidating with his colleges, who were puzzled by his seemingly erratic decision. He kept poor financial records within the company. He relied heavily on his instincts to make decisions.


&nbsp;&nbsp;


Putin is also described as a terrible administrator, but somewhat different from Durant. Everything has to be approved by him; people line up in front of his office for hours. Since he prefers to start his day late (waking up at 8:30AM and kicking off his day with a long gym session), he will have meetings regularly late at night, sometimes at 1AM in the morning. He uses public shaming of his cabinet members as a tool to push the blame of failed projects away from him.


&nbsp;&nbsp;


Both cases are what I call a “personification of organizations”. In both cases, the entire organization is bent to match the work style and preferences of their respective leaders. Unwritten customs are made not for the benefit of the organization, but for their own comfort. The entire organization becomes paralyzed by waiting for approvals that may take a day or several years depending on what the leader decides is important. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


So the important question to ask here is: Was Billy Durant, as many believed at the time, indispensable? Did his colleagues really need his help to make decisions on day-to-day operations in their divisions? The short answer is no. Durant had, unintentionally or not, created an organization that made him indispensable. In fact, the first tasks his successor Alfred Sloan did was to redistribute the responsibilities, setting up a simple decentralized system at GM where each division could operate like an autonomous body yet be answerable to a central authority. As a side note, he also modernized the accounting system to keep track of finances in all divisions of the company. Without these changes, General Motors would never have seen the massive growth through and after World War II. Nowadays, the success of General Motors is largely attributed to Alfred Sloan with Billy Durant, unfortunately, castaway in his shadows. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;


History has proven repeatedly that there is always a line behind us of brilliant talent waiting to fill in our place, no matter how hard we work, no matter how talented we regard ourselves. Charismatic leaders will either have to step down or undo the “personification” of their respective organizations, the only way to achieve it being the redistribution of responsibilities.


&nbsp;&nbsp;


The Russian government is, by no means, an exception.
