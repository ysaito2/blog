title:  "Argument for building a company around Elon Musk's vision"

When you look at every startup company, its basically a struggle to attract attention to their mission. Each company proposes a unique approach to solving an important problem. They then go through an painstaking process of convicing the most talented engineers and investors that their mission is more important than anything else that's out there. Each company has to bring a new insight into the world, something unique to attract attention to itself in a mob of thousands of new startups that are added to the community every year. 

&nbsp;

It goes without saying that the techinical foundation behind each of these startups have to be solid. But there are countless startups, current and the ones failed in the past, tackling more the less similar problems. Framing the problem in the right way and attracting talent matters. 

&nbsp;

Looking into many companies in domains like gene-editing, VR, processors, AI, space, self-driving, etc, its easy to notice that they all have compelling arguments for why their mission is important. The clever and accomplished founders communicate their visions of the future that sounds well, pretty exciting and meaningful. 

&nbsp;

But there is one entrepreneur that clearly stands out in communicating a compelling future and his name is Elon Musk. The best engineers in the world will stand behind the vision he articulates. The fact is nobody alive can catch the imagination of the world better than he has. Period. 

&nbsp;

Now, then why should anyone bother coming up with a vision to join the brawl among millions of startups when *we already have a vision that anyone around the world can rally behind.* Why not just build a company with a simple statement: "To accelerate the process of realizing Elon Musk's vision by creating the next building blocks of technologies for a multi-planetry civilization."

&nbsp;

The company can systematically break down gaps and identify what the next building blocks of technology are for building Elon Musk's vision of a thriving civilization here on Earth and Mars. No need to convince anybody why our mission is exciting and meaningful. External communications will focus on the engineering approach that is determined the best course to take to realize the corporate statement. The best engineers who see our approach is correct will join the organization. (Or not, in which case, iterate on the engineering approach until it is right)

&nbsp;

Whew, no hand waving, interviews, and emotional talks. Great.

&nbsp;

I wrote down a list of reasons why this would be a good idea:
* No need to go around trying to convince people why our mission is important
* Recruiting should be easier since the company should standout among millions of startups
* Its unlikely the technology we built will go to waste since there will surely be others around the world inspired by the vision to pursue it
* The progress made by SpaceX will add more value to the technology that we are building 
* It would be cool to know that when the company is successful, we will have a pipeline to Elon Musk. It would be awesome to meet him in person one day. 

&nbsp;

I am trying to come up with a list of why this would be bad idea and the risks involved. I guess one would be SpaceX building the technology and out-maneuver in the process. There is also a risk of the company being purchased by SpaceX in the future (I'm not sure if this is bad or not). Generating revenue in a space venture will continue to be enormously difficult. Our success will rely on many external factors that we have no control over. Once the company *is successful*, the best engineers will most likely be head-hunted by SpaceX. 

&nbsp;

Its a bold proposition. I like it.
