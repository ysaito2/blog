How could I have been so ignorant?

&nbsp;

I recently learned about Marvin Minsky, who has been repeatedly mentioned by Jaron Lanier as his most important mentor. Other promiment figures from his research group includes Ray Kurzweil and . I started listening to his talks scattered across youtube and his writings like ["steps toward artificial intelligence"](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/pdf/steps.pdf), publications, and [MIT lecture series "Society of Mind"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-868j-the-society-of-mind-fall-2011/). 

&nbsp;

I am embarrassed I didn't know about him until end of 2021. 

&nbsp;

Now, where do I start?

&nbsp;

He is a fountain of ideas.   
And its not note those spam-like ideas, but real genuine ones that push the frontiers of fields incompassing AI, cognition, neurology, and computation. Listening to a him talk for a half an hour cutting through all the speculations and bullshit is a true joy.
