## 2012 - college entry (18) to 2022 - 3rd year in industry (27)
### Accomplishments
 - recieved a college diploma (B.S.+M.S. in Aerospace Eng.)
 - first job in industry 
    - had many opportunities of exploration (research in national lab, CRUD app dev for Toyota, sales, machine learning, image processing, text processing, material science)
    - talked to people from many industries during job hunting, at job, and industry events 
    - understand the "common sense" of large businesses and how they work 
 - practiced skills in communication (writing + public speaking)
 - learning how to learn
 - lots of reading (microbiology, machine learning, history, economics, history of industries, technology+society, CAD, VR, electronics, computers, physics)
 - know where to go for information in each space
    - autonomous driving - comma.ai (george hotz)
    - space exploration - mars society (robert zubrich), everyday astranaut
    - FHI, 
    - 80,000 hours, 
    - effective alturism, 
    - lex friedman podcast, 
    - the odin - Josiah Zayner, 
    - cardano - chris hitchinson, 
    - jaron lanier
    - software/engineering - alan kay
 - after learning/doing many things, I have confidence that I can solve any problem, do well in any challenge I face
 - fairly good understanding of who I am (what I like, what I don't like, what I'm good at, what I'm bad at)

&nbsp;
### How could I have done better
- Wasted too much time in research that I did not care about which I was not partically good at 
- I should have joined more hands-on projects that were audacious during college, though I did not have confidence in my abilities at the time
- I was inefficient with my methology for learning, particularly in college
    - you learn most from DOING, even though reading is important
    - follow *people* that interest you, not the technology or domain

&nbsp;

### Summary
- I feel I could not commit to any field due to lack of understanding myself. If I knew I wanted to become an engineer in space industry at age 18, with laser-focused on a goal (i.e. getting a job in spacex), I would have been able to accomplish it  
- I was able to get a full understanding of my priorities. With my priorities straighted out, I now don't have any doubt in my judgements. 
- I now have a high confidence on my capabilities to make clear, rational judgements.

&nbsp;

## 2022 - 3rd year in industry (27) to 2032 - 13th year in industry (37)
### Primary goals
- sole purpose of the 10 years until 37 *should be to accumulate capital for future endeveours*
- generate revenue of ~$1B that can be used to invest in ambitious endeavour
- learn how to run/operate a business 

&nbsp;

### Details
- build first company 
    - be an *international* business
    - customers should be able to *buy* good/service online
    - build a product that I can *brag* about to friends
    - first product should be built within *3 months* 
    - make a sales within *6 months*
    - strong engineering/science foundation

&nbsp;
### Thoughts
- Imagining an Intel-like company, taking science in laboratories and bringing the technology to society to revolutionalize the world (integrated circuits is an invention that had to be done by industry)
- I think my role that fits me is to take good science in laboratories and scale the technology in industry to bring to masses (bridge between labs and industry)
- Build skills that make you productive / do what you want to do from mid-thirties onwards
- The field to be one where it defuses to all industries since I get bored pretty quickly
- Technology is a great way to cheat, do more with less 
- Learning history is a way to cheat by learning from mistakes made in past
    - by reading books, like wakata-san in simulating robotic arm on ISS the day before (he spents an entire day in the simulator), you can avoid mistakes by paying with your own time. Mistakes in the real world have to be paid with jobs, millions of dollars, and worst case harm to consumers/society
- It wouldn't make sense to start a company unless you can grow faster than 10% every year (standard for index funds)
- Interesting fields: metaverse+VR+AR (unreal), micropayment (cardano), reinforcement learning (deepmind, comma.ai, tesla), material science (japan academia), microbiology/synthetic biology (the odin). space exploration (spaceX)
- What's something that will be valuable in the next 10 years? What are changes that will happen between 2022 - 2032? 
- business has to be capable with low initial capital (software-heavy)
- I want the first business to be create a platform for subsequent businesses 
- what's the problem with the current software?
- want to build an exclusive supercomputer for future endeveours for massive parallel computation
- Join portion of industry that removes the lottery ticket element - rockefeller
- Company has to be technology agnostic
- Generate a fairly predictable income by 2025
- investment is a long waiting process, by building companies and technology we can bring the future faster
- what is something you could do now that you can't do any time else? 
    - cardano 
        - rising platform, **now would be the best time to go on and do something**
        - if we do NOT transfer from a open-free economy to a micropayment economy where people are given credit for their work, all industries will follow music/journalism wipe out a middle-class
        - Pro: 
            - i think the community is asking all the right questions
            - lots of great software engineers are in the community 
            - building on the platform (using haskell) will make you a great software engineer by thinking software in terms of systems
        - Con: 
            - way to monetize the business is unclear

    - unreal engine (AR+VR+metaverse)
        - another rising platform, a lot of developments happening now like development of a new programming language 
        - cool platform to build something on
        - even though it was fun, I realized fiddling around with game engines is too tedious for me!

    - space exploration 
        - starship development progress should be followed closely 
        - it will take at least another 5-7 years until regular flights are open to public
        - opportunity should rise with low cost + more human launches than every before 
        - i feel many people are waiting opportunity to make EVA spacesuits
        - cheap/mass produced life support systems should be next after reducing costs of getting mankind to space
        - surprisingly, no concrete plans for mars colonization to date
        - space elevator commitee in japan have everything figured out (we can use existing materials for the cables, currently its just too expensive!)
        - area i would like to join in future, have to figure out exactly *how*
        - Pro 
            - can be part of creating history, generation will be remembered as first generation to build a civilization on mars! 
        - Con
            - currently there is still limited commercial opportunities

    - renewable energy 
        - **regulations choose the winner**
            - i dont like the fact that you are at the whims of the government!
        - i think the **technology agnostic area** will be in virtual powerplants, which is the software mediated energy network concept (western europe is ahead of the pack) 
            - there will constantly be new methods of generating energy, storing energy so it is impossible to see which technology will win
        - **fairly slow progress** 
        - interesting developments in microgrids in developing countries
            - i guess microgrids would be one area that would be done bottom up, but current battery/solar technology means it can only be done in developing countries with low power needs
        - worth noting Japan is the only country with two seperate systems between west and east, and 3000 islands so its a interesting case where many foreign companies are focusing on (the japanese energy startup community is a diverse and international)

    - biology 
        - smartest academics are currently working on neuroscience 
        - worth noting reduction in DNA sequencing costs, human genome project hasn't contributed to development of new medical treatment
        - interesting community lead movements like open insulin 
        - there should be more community lead movements as biology becomes more accessible (the Odin is pushing for it as with many other biohacking spaces)
        - many optimistic forecasts but biology is super hard and messy!
        - lots of "artistry" involved in experiments
        - anything that will be fed into human beings require long development times to ensure safety, not a quick pratical startup 
        - again, the technology agnostic development will be in software since there are many measurement techniques in development for wearable medical devices with no clear winner


    - material science 
        - potential to push up all other industries
        - developments are an ongoing process 
        - will deepmind come up with AI system for material discovery?  
        - academic focus is on linking properties in different scales (multi-scale modelling) to design new large polymers (areas like tires and adhesives)
        - projects using the fugaku supercomputer have just started (April, 2021) and should have interesting results in the upcoming years
            - current applications are mostly in large scale simulations like wind turbines, coal powerplants, wind farms, and new drugs
        - **interesting discussions on decenteralizing the chemical industry reliant on fossil fuel to a biomass chemistry industry in japan academia** 
        - the bottleneck for other industries (space exploration, renewables, sustainablility) ending up being current materials being too expensive or non-existent so it is a high impact field 
        - for japan, with great applied physists and chemists, this will be the key strategic industry to focus on (together with biology)
        - i think material science is a good field to be good at, but you want to be in the field to apply the technology to get the most benefit (and money, of course!) 

    - AGI 
        - Ben A. building a network of AI, 
        - credit system for contributing datasets
        - honestly, a bit wacky cannot see the timeline 

    - reinforcement learning 
        - i think opportunity will come up when FSD is solved and many applications for real-world AI immerges
        - tesla/comma.ai are ahead of the pack for real world systems, deepmind for solving hard science problems
        - many applications of vision-based AI systems

&nbsp;
## 2032 - 13th year in industry (37) to 2042 - 23th year in industry (47)
- use the capital accumulated in the last ten years to finance audacious projects
- project 1. built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan

&nbsp;
## 2042 - 23th year in industry (47) to 2052 - 33th year in industry (57)
- project 2. build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D for space exploration 
- would like to start building institutions/foundations to push humanity outward to space

&nbsp;
## 2052 - 33th year in industry (57) to 2062 - 43th year in industry (67) 
- project 3. fix education: create a flagship school (with environment of future as in Alan Kay talk) for future generations 
- concerned with children in developing countries falling behind to developed countries concentrating resource on fewer children (possibly of gene editing new borns in developed nations)
- by this time, we need to make sure people are not discredited as useless by large computers/algorithms. People ARE ESSENTIAL for generating data to train better AI models. Should transfer from free-open web -> micropayment economy where people are given credit for their work. 

&nbsp;
## 2062 - 43th year in industry (67) to 2072 - 53th year in industry (77)
- project 4. ?
- solidify the institutions build until this time

&nbsp;
## 2072 - 53th year in industry (77) to 2082 - 63th year in industry (87)
- project 5. ?
- I hope medical technologies is advanced enough that my mind is still sharp

&nbsp;
## 2082 - 63th year in industry (87) to 2092 - 73th year in industry (97)
- project 6. ?
- invest accumulated wealth to new generation of entrepreneurs/engineers/scientists
- cool to see technolgy created in research laboratories used by companies for ambitious endeavours
- help researchers in laboratories build good companies and create great jobs in the industry

&nbsp;
## 2092 - 73th year in industry (97) to 2095 - Dead (100)
- start writing a biography about myself
- follow Newton, make memorable stories (apple falling story) for propensity to remember me by 
- give public lectures on what I did in my life

&nbsp;
## 2095 - Dead (100)
- not planning to live past 100, don't see any reason to live beyond
