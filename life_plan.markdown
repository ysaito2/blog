## Edit history: 
2022/01/09 - first draft of plan until reaching 100

## Timeline:
2012 - college entry (18)
 - recieved a college diploma (B.S.+M.S. in Aerospace)
 - first job in software industry 
 - had many opportunities of exploration (research in national lab, CRUD app dev for Toyota, short stint in consulting, sales, machine learning, image processing, text processing, material science)
 - talked to people from many industries during job hunting, at job, and industry events 
 - refined skills in communication (writing + public speaking)
 - learning how to learn
 - having a solid understanding (technical+history) of computer science
 - lots of reading (microbiology, machine learning, history, economics, history of industries, technology+society, CAD, VR, electronics, computers, physics)
 - understand the "common sense" of large businesses and industry
 - know where to go for information in the intellectual community (comma.ai(george hotz), space exploration(robert zubrich), coding, FHI, 80,000 hours, effective alturism, lex friedman podcast, the odin (Josiah Zayner), good books, etc)
 - after learning/doing many things, I have confidence that I can solve any problem, do well in any challenge I face
 - fairly good understanding of who I am (what I like, what I don't like, what I'm good at, what I'm bad at)

 who I respect/follow: 
 Jaron Lanier, Alan Kay, Robert Zubrich (mars society) 
 
 Entrepreneurs:
 Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, George Hotz, Josiah Zayner, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Ted Turner, Henry Ford

 Academia: 
 Marvin Minsky, Steven Pinker, Niel Ferguson, Richard Feynman,  

 How could I have done better:
- Wasted too much time in research that I did not care about which I was not partically good at 
- I should have joined more hands-on projects that were audacious (cubesat, ) during college, I did not have confidence in my abilities at the time
- could have been more audacious on projects, what to work on 
- overall though, satisfied with where I stand
- inefficient with how I learned, particularlly in college
    - you learn most from DOING, even though reading is important
- I feel if I was laser-focused on a goal (i.e. getting a job in spacex), I would have been able to reach the goal 

2022 - 3rd year in industry (27)
Primary goals: 
- sole purpose of the 10 years until 37 *should be to accumulate capital for future endeveours*
- obtain a fortune generate revenue of ~$1B that can be used to invest in ambitious endeavour
- learn how to run/operate a business 

Details: 
- build first company 
    - be an *international* business to take advantage of background
    - customers should be able to *buy* good/service online
    - build a product that I can *brag* about to friends
    - product should be built within *3 months* 
    - make a sales within *6 months*
    - strong engineering/science foundation
- imagining an Intel-like company, taking science in laboratories and bringing the technology to society to revolutionalize the world (integrated circuits is an invention that had to be done by industry)
- I think my role that fits me is to take good science in laboratories and scale the technology in industry to bring to masses (bridge between labs and industry)
- It would be interesting for the science field to be one where it defuses to all industries since I get bored pretty quickly
- technology is a great way to cheat, do more with less 
- learning history is a way to cheat by learning from mistakes made in past
    - by reading books, like wakata-san in simulating robotic arm on ISS the day before (he spents an entire day in the simulator), you can avoid mistakes by paying with your own time. Mistakes in the real world have to be paid with jobs, millions of dollars, and worst case harm to consumers/society
- build skills that make you productive / do what you want to do from mid-thirties onwards
- it wouldn't make sense to start a company unless you can grow faster than 10% every year (standard for index funds)
- do 20% currency (fiat 50%, crypto 50%), 80% index fund considering its vital for the micropayment economy to be successful
- interesting fields: metaverse+VR+AR (unreal), micropayment (cardano), reinforcement learning (deepmind, comma.ai, tesla), material science (?), microbiology/synthetic biology (the odin). space exploration (spaceX)
- What's something that will be valuable in the next 10 years? What are changes that will happen between 2022 - 2032? 

goals in life: 
- fix education: create a flagship school (with environment of future as in Alan Kay talk) for future generations 
    -> I spent two summers working in education non-profit! I really care
- build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D for space exploration 
    -> joy from talking to researchers / process of scientific discovery
    -> five nobel prizes from the institution within 5 decades 
    -> low budget commited for ~10 year period
    -> any audacious engineering projects require pushing boundary of material science 
- built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan, like Toyota/Sony

Questions:
- what to do with software shrinking opportunities in many industries (starting from music, journalism) 
- why were "moonshot" projects in the past successful?
    - xerox parc       - all technology for personal computers created by 25 researchers, $10M a year for 5 years 
    - mahattan project - development of atomic bomb in 1939~1945
    - apollo project   - landing in man on moon within a decade

2032 - 13th year in industry (37)
- use the capital accumulated in the last ten years to finance audacious projects
- project 1. built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan, like Toyota/Sony

2042 - 23th year in industry (47)
- project 2. build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D for space exploration 
    -> joy from talking to researchers / process of scientific discovery
    -> five nobel prizes from the institution within 5 decades 
    -> low budget commited for ~10 year period
- would like to start building institutions/foundations to push humanity outward to space

2052 - 33th year in industry (57)
- project 3. fix education: create a flagship school (with environment of future as in Alan Kay talk) for future generations 
    - concerned with children in developing countries falling behind to developed countries concentrating resource on fewer children (possibly gene editing)
    - by this time, we need to make sure people are not discredited as useless by large computers/algorithms. People ARE ESSENTIAL for generating data to train better AI models. Should transfer from free-open web -> micropayment economy where people are given credit for their work. 

2062 - 43th year in industry (67) 
- project 4. ?
    - solidify the institutions build until data

2072 - 53th year in industry (77)
- project 5. ?

2082 - 63th year in industry (87)
- project 6. 
    - invest accumulated wealth to new generation of entrepreneurs/engineers/scientists
    - cool to see technolgy created in research laboratories used by companies for ambitious endeveours

2092 - 73th year in industry (97)
- start writing a biography about myself
- follow Newton, make memorable stories (apple falling story) for propensity to remember me by 
- give public lectures on what I did in my life

2095 - Dead (100)
- not planning to live past 100, don't see any reason to live beyond
