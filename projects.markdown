I identified six projects that I want to work on during my lifetime. Each project will be allocated a 10-year timeframe. The projects will have periodic reviews to make sure the project is progressing accordingly. The timeline of the projects will have to reiterated to make adjustments as I figure out the best way it works for me. I added more reviews upfront since there is potential to make large improvements to optimize the projects. 

&nbsp;

## Project timeline

**end of year 1.** 
- Make sure the goal for the next 10 years is expressed clearly, with KPIs so that success (or failure) can be measured properly
- Make sure the goal is *relevant* with the timeframe you are working on (don't start a project too early or too late)
- Run some small scale experiments to check bottlenecks. Flush out the risks involved in the projects. Brainstorm ideas to overcome the risks. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 3.**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Is it progressing accordingly? If it is not, this would be the time to radically change approach. 

&nbsp;

**end of year 5**
- Check with the KPIs of the project to assess progress.
- Find out what are bottlenecks in the progress of project, make minor changes as required
- There should be **NO radical changes** to the approach at this stage. Even if your stuck with an less than optimal approach, stick with your guns
- Review improvements that can be made. Implement to guide the project to success in the next five years

&nbsp;

**end of year 10.** 
- review the result of the project
- list lessons to learned that can be translated to future projects

&nbsp;

## project list

### project 1.

Built a flagship SpaceX-like engineering company that represents Japan, at a scale equivalent to Toyota/Sony

&nbsp;

**Background**

The progress made in developed countries are showing signs of stagnation. Though developing countries, including China, are making rapid progress by following the footsteps of developed nations, there is no clear indication that they have solution for the next steps mankind will take. 

&nbsp;

**Reason**

I believe one solution to develop *developed* countries is for future entrepreneurs to adopt the methodology that Elon Musk follows to pursue audacious projects. It would be exciting to see thousands of Elon Musk-styled businesses springing up around the world taking a highly effective approach to solving world problems. The company will demonstrate that Elon's approach can be applied by any organization around the world. 

&nbsp;

**KPIs**

- number one company traded on the nikkei index

&nbsp;


### project 2.

Build a world-class material science/microbiology R/D center to push the envelope of what's possible

&nbsp;

Background

The bottleneck for many audacious projects like fusion reactors, space elevators, and low cost desalination technology are usually constrained by either existing materials being too expensive or non-existant. Pushing the frontier of material science will have ripple effects on all existing industries, creating new companies and industries. 

&nbsp;

Concept

- low budget commited for ~10 year period
- small number of elite scientists (20-30) gathered from worldwide 

&nbsp;

KPIs

- five nobel prizes from the institution within 5 decades 

&nbsp;

### project 3.

fix education by creating a flagship school 

&nbsp;

Background

Education has made little to no progress in the last 100 years. Many bright minds have taken a shot at fixing it, but has not been successful. 

Concept

implement the environment of future proposed by Alan Kay in schools

KPIs

TBD

&nbsp;

### project 4.

Decenteralizing the chemical industry reliant on fossil fuel to a biomass chemical industry (japan academia Kyushuu University prof)

Background

As jobs and industries become more concentrated in the cities, since Henry Ford's times, we need to create industries for small towns/farms to create income around the world. This would alleviate poverty/social instability not just in developing countries, but around the world. 

Reason

- help reduce the reliance on unstable global trade network by producing/consuming on site
- create opportunities and jobs in rural parts of the world
- the business can be scaled globally 
- help solve the trash, pollution problem (primarily in developing countries like india)

&nbsp;

### project 5.

implement the micro-finance system to give credit to people generating data ( how to implement in manufactoring and other industries)

Background

Networked computers had destroyed the journalism and music industries by wiping out the middle classes based on the open/free concept of the world-wide web. This trend will cascade to all other industries as time passes with technological advancement (do more with less). The question is "How do you make money when everything is free?". Particularly worrisome is the impact to manufactoring in the far east asia, where we are already seeing the adoption of 3D printers and autonomous robots. 

There needs to be a system implemented where people are given credit for contributing their data/knowledge to automate/improve the system. 

Reason

- there needs to be a system where workers generating data are given credit to automate processes in the manufactoring line
- as robots generate value, humans should be given credit based on productivity increases
- 3D models/designs on the web just CANNOT be free; there needs to be a mechanism to give credit to the designer

&nbsp;

### project 6. 

TBD
