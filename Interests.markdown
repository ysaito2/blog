## cryptocurrency - cardano 
- rising platform, **now would be the best time to go on and do something**
- if we do NOT transfer from a open-free economy to a micropayment economy where people are given credit for their work, all industries will follow music/journalism wipe out a middle-class
- Pro: 
    - i think the community is asking all the right questions
    - lots of great software engineers are in the community 
    - building on the platform (using haskell) will make you a great software engineer by thinking software in terms of systems
- Con: 
    - way to monetize the business is unclear

&nbsp;

## AR+VR+metaverse - unreal engine 
- another rising platform, a lot of developments happening now like development of a new programming language 
- cool platform to build something on
- even though it was fun, I realized fiddling around with game engines is too tedious for me!
- pro
    - fun to play around with 
- con 
    - don't see a huge social impact 
    - pretty tedious

&nbsp;

## space exploration - spacex 
- starship development progress should be followed closely 
- it will take at least another 5-7 years until regular flights are open to public
- opportunity should rise with low cost + more human launches than every before 
- i feel many people are waiting opportunity to make EVA spacesuits
- cheap/mass produced life support systems should be next after reducing costs of getting mankind to space
- we want to sent people to space, not robots, to create jobs and industries, which will push for investments in infrastructure
- surprisingly, no concrete plans for mars colonization to date even by mars society 
- space elevator commitee in japan have everything figured out (we can use existing materials for the cables, currently its just too expensive!)
- area i would like to join in future, have to figure out exactly *how*
- Pro 
    - can be part of creating history, generation will be remembered as first generation to build a civilization on mars! 
- Con
    - currently there is still limited commercial opportunities

&nbsp;

## renewable energy 
- **regulations choose the winner**
    - i dont like the fact that you are at the whims of the government!
- i think the technology agnostic area will be in **virtual powerplants**, which is the software mediated energy network concept 
- as far as i understand, companies in western europe  ahead of the pack, but there are national research institutes in the US that do research in the field
- there will constantly be new methods of generating and storing energy so it is impossible to tell which technology will win
- **fairly slow progress** 
- interesting developments in microgrids in developing countries
    - Microgrids would be one area that would be done bottom up, but current battery/solar technology means it can only be done in developing countries **with low power needs**
    - Microgrids is also an area that will be software mediated 
- worth noting Japan is the only country with two seperate systems between west and east, and 3000 islands so its a interesting case where many foreign companies are focusing on (the japanese energy startup community is a diverse and international)
- pro 
    - massive business opportunity to overhaul existing global energy infrastructure 
- con
    - highly sensitive to regulations and political climate 
    - very competitive space with every niche filled already

&nbsp;

## biology 
- smartest academics are currently working on neuroscience 
- worth noting reduction in DNA sequencing costs, human genome project hasn't contributed to development of new medical treatment
- interesting community lead movements like open insulin 
- there should be more community lead movements as biology becomes more accessible (the Odin is pushing for it as with many other biohacking spaces)
- many optimistic forecasts but biology is super hard and messy!
- lots of "artistry" involved in experiments
- anything that will be fed into human beings require long development times to ensure safety, not a quick pratical startup 
- again, the technology agnostic development will be in software since there are many measurement techniques in development for wearable medical devices with no clear winner

## material science 
- potential to push up all other industries
- developments are an ongoing process 
- will deepmind come up with AI system for material discovery?  
- academic focus is on linking properties in different scales (multi-scale modelling) to design new large polymers (areas like tires and adhesives)
- projects using the fugaku supercomputer have just started (April, 2021) and should have interesting results in the upcoming years
    - current applications are mostly in large scale simulations like wind turbines, coal powerplants, wind farms, and new drugs
- **interesting discussions on decenteralizing the chemical industry reliant on fossil fuel to a biomass chemistry industry in japan academia** 
- the bottleneck for other industries (space exploration, renewables, sustainablility) ending up being current materials being too expensive or non-existent so it is a high impact field 
- for japan, with great applied physists and chemists, this will be the key strategic industry to focus on (together with biology)
- i think material science is a good field to be good at, but you want to be in the field to apply the technology to get the most benefit (and money, of course!) 

## AGI 
- Ben A. building a network of AI, 
- credit system for contributing datasets
- honestly, a bit wacky cannot see the timeline 

## reinforcement learning 
- i think opportunity will come up when FSD is solved and many applications for real-world AI immerges
- tesla/comma.ai are ahead of the pack for real world systems, deepmind for solving hard science problems
- many applications of vision-based AI systems
