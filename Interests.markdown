## cryptocurrency - cardano 
- rising platform, **now would be the best time to go on and do something**
- if we do NOT transfer from a open-free to a micropayment economy where people are given credit for their work, all industries will follow music/journalism industries that got their middle classes wiped out
- Pro: 
    - i think the community is asking all the right questions
    - lots of great software engineers are in the community 
    - building on the platform (using haskell) will make you a great software engineer
    - opportunities to work with like-minded people
    - able to understand how finance will work in this century
- Con: 
    - ways to monetize the business is unclear

&nbsp;

## AR+VR+metaverse - unreal engine 
- another rising platform, a lot of developments happening now like development of a new programming language 
- fun platform to build something on
- even though it was fun, I realized fiddling around with game engines is too tedious for me!
- tried integrating with reinforcement learning, but since game engines are **not reproducable** every simulation, it cannot be used for QA testing of vision-based AI models
- pro
    - fun to play around with 
    - it could lead to expansion of economy with digital overlaying reality
- con 
    - pretty tedious
    - metaverse is a long time away
    - meeting hardware requirements (that is mass-scaled and low cost) should be decades ahead

&nbsp;

## space exploration - spacex 
- starship development progress should be followed closely 
- it will take at least another 5-7 years until regular flights 
- maybe 10 years for flights to be open to public
- opportunity should rise with low cost + more human launches than every before 
- cheap/mass produced life support systems should be next after reducing costs of getting mankind to space
    - i feel many people are waiting opportunity to make EVA spacesuits
- we want to sent people to space, not robots, to create jobs and industries, which will push for investments in infrastructure
- surprisingly, no concrete plans for mars colonization to date even by mars society 
- space elevator commitee in japan have everything figured out (we can use existing materials for the cables, currently its just too expensive!)
- area i would like to join in future, have to figure out exactly *how*
- Pro 
    - can be part of creating history, generation will be remembered as first generation to build a civilization on mars! 
- Con
    - currently there is still limited commercial opportunities

&nbsp;

## renewable energy 
- **regulations choose the winner**
    - i dont like the fact that you are at the whims of the government!
- i think the technology agnostic area will be in **virtual powerplants**, which is the software mediated energy network concept 
- as far as i understand, companies in western europe ahead of the pack, but there are national research institutes in the US that do research in the field
- there will constantly be new methods of generating and storing energy so it is impossible to tell which technology will win
- there is also a process of making current methods of generating energy (adding ammonia to gas turbines) and manufactoring (iron, cement) more green
    - obviously **huge** capital costs involved
- **fairly slow progress** 
- interesting projects in microgrids in developing countries
    - Microgrids would be one area that would be done bottom up, but current battery/solar technology means it can only be done in developing countries **with low power needs**
    - Microgrids is also an area that will be software mediated 
- worth noting Japan is the only country with two seperate systems between west and east, and 3000 islands so its a interesting case where many foreign companies are focusing on (the japanese energy startup community is a diverse and international)
- pro 
    - massive business opportunity to overhaul entire global energy infrastructure 
- con
    - highly sensitive to regulations and political climate 
    - very competitive space with every niche filled already
    - not a whole lot of *energy* in the space, seems a bit of a downturn now

&nbsp;

## biology 
- smartest academics are currently working on neuroscience 
- worth noting reduction in DNA sequencing costs, human genome project hasn't contributed to development of new medical treatment
- interesting community led movements like open insulin 
    - there should be more community lead movements as biology becomes more accessible (the Odin is pushing for it as with many other biohacking spaces)
- many optimistic forecasts but biology is super hard and messy!
    - lots of "artistry" involved in experiments
- anything that will be fed into human bodies require long development times to ensure safety, not a quick pratical startup 
- again, the technology agnostic will be in software since there are many measurement techniques in development for wearable medical devices with no clear winner
- i think bio-hacking will continue to be a fun hobby for me, not a means of making money 
- pro
    - lots of energy in the community, many interesting people 
    - experiments are super fun and cool
- con
    - hard  
    - takes many years to get products/services to market
    - experiments are kinda tedious at times

&nbsp;

## material science 
- potential to push up all other industries
- developments are an ongoing process 
- will deepmind come up with AI system for material discovery?  
- academic focus is on linking properties in different scales (multi-scale modelling) to design new large polymers (areas like tires and adhesives)
- projects using the fugaku supercomputer have just started (April, 2021) and should have interesting results in the upcoming years
    - current applications are mostly in large scale simulations like wind turbines, coal powerplants, wind farms, and new drugs
- **interesting discussions on decenteralizing the chemical industry reliant on fossil fuel to a biomass chemistry industry in japan academia** 
- the bottleneck for other industries (space exploration, renewables, sustainablility) ending up being current materials being too expensive or non-existent so success in material development can have massive impacts to other industries 
- for japan, with great applied physists and chemists, this will be the key strategic industry to focus on (together with biology) 
- i think material science is a good field to be good at, but you want to be in the field to apply the technology to get the most benefit (and money, of course!)
- pro
    - high impact field
    - potential to push frontier of what's possible
    - the japan material science community has the best scientists and engineers in the country working on audacious projects
- con
    - material companies generally have **very low profit margins**
    - you are at the whims of the OEMs you supply materials to

&nbsp;

## AGI 
- Ben Goertzel 
    - building a network of AIs that serve as agents that can communicate with each other - singularity-net 
    - credit system for contributing datasets - marketocean
    - sophia robot!
- both movements are interesting and one step towards the correct direction
- honestly, a bit wacky cannot see the timeline 
- pro
    - taking the right step forward
    - interesting development to keep an eye on time-to-time
- con
    - i think we are still a long way ahead
    - no idea how they are financing (and making money) on the projects
    - i feel the deepmind approach of using ai to tackle hard science problems seem the right way

&nbsp;

## reinforcement learning 
- i think opportunity will come up when FSD is solved and many applications for real-world AI immerges
- tesla/comma.ai are ahead of the pack for real world systems, deepmind for solving hard science problems
- many applications of vision-based AI systems
- projects run by deepmind have potential to have massive improvements to many industries
- pro
    - opportunity to make difference in many industries
    - lots of energy in the domain 
- con
    - little bit late/early to join at the current time
    - after FSD solved, more opportunities should rise (why stop with cars?)
